# **Country + Capital Matching Game**

This is a simple country/capital matching game developed with React and Typescript inspired by a [Web Dev Cody](https://www.youtube.com/@WebDevCody) video detailing a junior React interview challenge. The original video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTgB4esy1is).

Consumes the [Rest Countries API](https://restcountries.com/#rest-countries) using [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v3/) to provide a list of countries and capitals.
